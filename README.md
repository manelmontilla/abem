# abem
## This library is still in alpha status and not suitable to be used in production.
## I'm still learning Swift so probably te code is not very idiomatic.

Abem is a small utility library written is Swift that aims to expose the functionality provided by  
[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) but directly using "human generated"
passwords or passphrases. It uses the excellent [swift-sodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/swift-sodium)
interface to use li sodium.
